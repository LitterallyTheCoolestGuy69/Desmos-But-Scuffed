 Graphing utility thats semi useful

I made this within the first week of quarantine life and I'm proud of how it turned out

There are quite a few bugs within this code that I could probably fix now, now that I 
understand the JFrame and JPanel classes a lot more, but I'm not really interested in
doing so. 

There are a couple of things to note about the syntax, when you type in the bar, you 
must only type in the x side of a function, or a variable declaration. The code that 
interprets what you type *sort of* knows order of operations, but if you aren't 
getting your intended result it is probably best that you use parenthesis excessively,
and even then it may occasionally produce an unexpected result.

NEVER: type in y =

when you type the help command, it may look as though nothing happens, but if you drag 
your mouse around the center of the screen, text will start to appear, I could never 
figure out how to get rid of that bug :/ also when you type "c" to close the help 
information, enter it twice to fully get rid of the text (another bug I never managed
to fix). Besides that this should function as a regular graphing utility, sorry if code
is sloppy
